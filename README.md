# SalesforceCMSComponentLibrary with Reviewed UI

_This is a modified version of the SalesforceCMSComponentLibrary provided by SalesforceLabs._

Experience Cloud provides several standard CMS-related components focused on collections and other manually-curated pieces of content. These custom components complement those standard components and allow you to place relevant and dynamically-selected CMS content on topic detail and record detail pages. This can be used to inform customers and partners, drive context-specific calls to action,and to make your users much happier with the digital experience you create.

# Modifications on this project

_User friendly layout based on a card view_

The CMS content is displayed as cards in a 2 column layout. 

The fields shown in the card have been reduced to only show the key information, the image banner, the tittle and the excerpt - this last one is used to provide a quick summary of the CMS content.
